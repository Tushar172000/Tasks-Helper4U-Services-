## Task 1: HTTP GET Endpoint for Prime Numbers

This task involves creating an HTTP GET endpoint that returns all the prime numbers till a specified number. The endpoint accepts a parameter in the URL to specify the desired number.

### Instructions

1. Choose your preferred backend development environment (e.g., Node.js with Express).
2. Set up a new project and initialize it.
3. Install the required dependencies. For Node.js with Express, run `npm install express`.
4. Copy the provided code for the HTTP GET endpoint into your project's main file or create a new file specifically for handling routes.
5. Customize the code if needed (e.g., change the port number or add additional logic).
6. Start the server by running the command `node <your-main-file>.js` in your terminal.
7. Test the endpoint by making a GET request to `http://localhost:<port>/prime-numbers/<number>`, where `<port>` is the port number specified in the code and `<number>` is the desired number till which you want to find the prime numbers.

## Task 2: React Form with Validation

This task involves creating a React form with validation to collect information such as name, email, resident address, phone, and date of birth (DOB).

### Instructions

1. Set up a new React project using your preferred development environment or create a new component in an existing React project.
2. Install the required dependencies. For form validation, install `react-hook-form`.
3. Copy the provided code for the React form into your project's desired component file.
4. Customize the form fields, validation rules, and submission logic if needed.
5. Style the form as desired.
6. Run the React development server by running the command `npm start` in your terminal.
7. Access the form in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` or the specified port.
8. Fill in the form and test the validation by submitting the form.

## Task 3: HTTP POST Endpoint to Save Form Data

This task involves creating an HTTP POST endpoint that saves the data filled in the React form when the user clicks on the submit button after filling all the fields.

### Instructions

1. Choose your preferred backend development environment (e.g., PHP with a framework like Slim or Laravel).
2. Set up a new project and initialize it.
3. Install the required dependencies if using a framework.
4. Copy the provided code for the HTTP POST endpoint into your project's main file or create a new file specifically for handling routes.
5. Customize the code if needed (e.g., update the database connection details or add additional logic).
6. Start the server or the PHP development environment to run the PHP code.
7. Test the POST endpoint by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:<port>/submit-form` with the required form data in the request body.
8. Verify that the data is being saved to the MySQL database (make sure you have set up the database and updated the connection details in the code).
